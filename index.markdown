## I am a full-time Java developer in P92 IT Solutions Kft., Hungary, Budapest.

- I had tasks in the legacy project of *Barclays Premiere Rewards*, based of E-Message plus (technologies: **Spring, Hibernate, Portlets, MsSql** ... etc). I was also developing the new Liferay based projects of *Barclays*: the *PTB* and the *Barclays UK*. *PTB* contains REST WebServices, UK is the new *Barclays European* site.
- I was on the *Allegiant* project also. This is a Liferay 7 based project (frontend), and the backend uses **Java 8, Spring 4, Hibernate 5, Google ProtocolBuffer, MySql, and Tomcat, Microservice architecture**. *Allegiant* is a coupon management system for the *Irish post* (*AnPost*).- I was outsourced to the Visoft Kft for 8 months. I was on the *MAVIR's SOFI* project. The technologies: Backend: **Java 8, Hibernate 5, Oracle 12c, Spring 4**. Frontend: **JS (ES5), Handlebars, CommonJS** ... etc.
- In march of 2018 I was back to P92. I did some tasks on [parlament.hu][PlPh].
- My actual projects are the *Tesco Mobile*, *O2 Microsites*, *O2 Loyalty*, *SMS Portal* and the *IVR Engine*. Technologies: **Java 8, Liferay 7, Struts, MariaDB, MSSQL, Hibernate, Spring Boot, Docker, Git. Tools: Gradle, Bash, Awk**. Web services: **REST and SOAP** based. *Tesco Mobile* is the one of the world biggest virtual mobile provider services. Virtual, because the infrastructure is based on the British *O2 mobile* network. *Tesco mobile* project is connecting many outer systems for data, like Loqate, O2, Hansen ... etc systems with **SOAP and REST** based web services. The front-end is based on **Liferay 7.3** portlets, which are **Struts** portlets or new **Liferay MVC Portlet** based. There are three main sites in Tesco Mobile: the Care, Admin and the [www.mytescomobile.com][PlMt]. The IVR (Interactive Voice Recognition) is the automated call center. The test and live systems use IBM DB2 database with stored procedures. In the local environment the DB is **MariaDb**. Most of the outer systems working are simulated locally. I am working in the [payandgorewards.o2.co.uk][PlRw] and O2 Microsites projects also.
